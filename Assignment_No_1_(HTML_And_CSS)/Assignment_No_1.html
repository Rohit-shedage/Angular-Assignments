					Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML
					CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
					This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to
				    share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be 
				    cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
